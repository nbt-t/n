= ADDITION =
In considering a quantity with respect to the number of individuals it
encompasses, one may characterize such group through singular individuals, which all are alike, 1s,
until reaching the quantity of the original group. Thus, for clear convenience, any quantity is an
abstraction over a corresponding cluster of ones:

*1 = 1, 2 = 1+1, 3 = 1+1+1, 4 = 1+1+1+1, 5 = 1+1+1+1+1...*

Addition is fundamentally the succesive counting of ones.

5+5 = (1+1+1+1+1)+(1+1+1+1+1) = 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 = 10
x+y = (1x)+(1y) = 1+1... = z

= ASSOCIATIVE LAW =
*a+b+c = a+(b+c)*
*7+(5+2) = 7+7*

This law predicates that the position of parentheses in an expression does not have influence
on the quantity denoted.

Any group of individuals can be deemed whole through the use of parenthesis. All groups of
individuals have a logical association with their consequent wholes.

In any expression with parenthesis, their procedural deletion is an assertion of this law.

= COMMUTATIVE LAW =
*x+y+z = z+y+x*

This law asserts that the organization of the operands pertaining to an expression have zero bearing
on the final result.

= DISTRIBUTIVE LAW =
*x(y+z) = xy + xz*

This law states that if a number is multiplying a group, each term of the group is multiplied and
their subsequent products are added.
