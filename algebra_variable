[[math]]
Algebra is abstractly taller than [[arithmetic]]. *Variable as opposed to fixed*. Focusing on the [[generalization|general]] rules and properties of
[[mathematical operations]]. Mathematical symbols and their respective manipulation.

The basic component of all algebra, without which algebra is not adjacent to an [[mathematical_expression|expression]], is *variable*: it is a letter
that represents any [[number]], and, as ensuing, an unknown [[quantity]].

The properties that expressions originating inside arithmetic show about basic operations, their effect on numbers in
relation to number itself and structure, are *concisely summarized by algebraic expressions*; wielding variables
avoids the placement of numbers, of [[infinite]] trascendency, [[less wearisome]].

An *algebraic expression* is any mathematical expression that harbors variable.

An *algebraic expression* is any generic mathematical expression.
