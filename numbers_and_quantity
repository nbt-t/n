[[math]] [[set_theory]]
*Quantity* is the [[state]] of an [[equal]] assemblage of objects. At least a measure of 1, unique object, is compulsory to
predicating a object's positive existencial state. Whereas 0 or less of quantity assents at negative existencial
state.

*Quantity* is a set's length containing equal items.

From reckoning collections *existential quantity*, that is whose symbolic translation is [[whole]], always sprouts.
Whereas for the differing that to regarding spans or lengths, viz. the object as divided in units in place of
entirety, rather than collections in which [[unity]] guides reckoning, the name *metric quantity* conferred.

Objective/Existential Quantity and Subjective/Metric Quantity?

A number is a *quantity*, while a digit is a *single numerical symbol* that may be constituent of a number.

*Natural numbers*, aka, *counting numbers*, are all numbers one uses for counting: *{1, 2, 3, 4, 5...}*

*Whole numbers* are all natural numbers *N* in cojunction with *0*: *{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...}*

*Integers* are all numbers that do not possess a fractional part: *{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2...}*. Also, all whole and negative
numbers.

*Rational numbers* are all numbers that can be expressed as a quotient or as a fraction *a/b* such that *b* is a non-zero
number. *All integers are rational numbers*.
