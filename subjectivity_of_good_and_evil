[[philosophy]]
Nothing is universally right or bad, all right things have a bad side, and all bad has a good part. One can
consider the goodness of a matter through different perspectives, each bearing different result. That is, the
goodness of what one deems through one's own avail will be different to considering it with the advantage of
another object in mind.

For instance, if one's kid is claimed of his life by another, accidentally, in bad, there's one's sorrow, the other's
distress, and et cetera, then in good, there's the now absent waste the kid would have produced on earth, among possibly
complementary instances.
