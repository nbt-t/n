*HTML*, short for _HyperText Markup Language_, is the universal _markup_ language of the Web. Its
_Markup Language_ part refers to that which purpose is definining the empirical structure of
text.

= Process of loading a website =
The browser inquires for the website's information to the _web server_, which then sends
back to it the corresponding data for the browser to process and render; the data can be
HTML files, images, videos, etc.

A *web server* is essentially a computer that's constantly waiting for requests from other
computers about information (html files, images, videos, etc).

The *browser* is the engine that processes and renders websites according to the information
provided by their container web server.

= Foundational concepts of HTML =
A *tag* is the _markup_ that dictates the structure of a website. These determine the intention
of the enclosed text; if its a header, paragraph, title, etc.

An *element* is the conjunction of an opening tag, text, and a closing tag.

The *attribute* of an element is an additional piece of information about such.

Both an opening tag and its closing tag are considered *matching tags*.

= <html> & <head> tags =
The *<html>* tag merely asserts that a file is an HTML file.

The *<head>* tag is used to define metadata about the website; such as its title, style, etc.
