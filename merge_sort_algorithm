= Working =
Moves in array until finds greater than the corresponding item in the other array; move in array whose item is least.
Before appending a number, it further checks in the other array for a smaller number, that's smart.  

Finally, if either indices do not beat last item, which indicates that all items from the unfinished array are greater than
the last item in the merged list, such remaining items are appended accordingly with no comparsion.
