= Symlink =
A *symlink* (also called _symbolic link_ or _soft link_) is a file that represents a
unidirectonial connection to another file. It's like an _alias_ for a file.

= Hard Link =
A *hard link* is, in essence, an identical copy of a file. Thereupon, one may safely venture
to deem a hard link to be the same as a copy produced by the _cp_ command, but that's
faulty: hard links have the same inode as their target file.

Every file has at least one hard link bearing its name.

= Symlink VS Hard Link =
* Hard links cannot be directories.
* Symlinks can span across different drives, while hard links cannot.
