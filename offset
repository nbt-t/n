An *offset* is the semantic translation of distance/displacement to computer science, but _can only be integer_.

Specifically, an array's _positive_ *index*, aka *offset*, is the displacement departing from its first element:

{{{python
arr = ['t', 'e', 's', 't']
arr_element_pos = 3
first_element_pos = 1
arr[arr_element_pos-first_element_pos] # -> 's'
}}}
Essentially, when we specify an element's position, by supreme convention always commencing from the leftmost
element (the first one), we are declaring the amount of elements to traverse so to attain such element.
