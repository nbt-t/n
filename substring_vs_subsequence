A *substring* is a string slice, of step 1, where each element's adjacency to the other coincides in the original string.
While, a *subsequence*, being not inevitably a group of coincidental adjacency but so necessarily maintaining the same
order as in the original string; a greater-than-or-equal-to-one step for string slicing in subsequences befits.

All substrings are subsequences, but not viceversa. Therefore, substrings are specific instances of subsequences.

In subsequences, adjecency per element may or not be true.
