[[programming]] [[cs]]
The step of the recursive dance is done when a function's output is fed as input into itself, may it be repeatedly
across the completion of range. But exception when the function manipulates the input, only until the first domain
element's output that it'll be copied within range, or only in the second function call is when identity of input
and output will match for either sets; that is, the difference betweeen domain and range, it be possible, is
domain's first element.
