[[programming]]
A programmer's virtuosity is gauged by ability to:

* [[foreseeing_programs_behavior|Accurately foresee programs' behavior]],
* [[describing_processes_in_the_least_time_span|describe processes in the least time span]],
* [[laying_instructions_of_utmost_time_efficiency|lay instructions of utmost time efficiency]],
* [[expressing_instructions_after_a_human_readable_fashion|and to express instructions after a human-readable fashion]].

Each of the aforementioned, backed with _foreseeing the behavior of programs_, greater emphasized in line with the
purpose of the programmer; for if under the need of  outing a program as soon as possible, it confers to virtue
_describing processes in the least time span_, whereas squeezed by the urge of framing a lightning-quick program,
virtuosity it speaks of _laying instructions of utmost time efficiency_, and both, _both_ of favor.

After acquainting one's grasp with the idiom of computational instructions, proficiency is roused by gradual
apprehension about quickness of programming and execution.

Hence, ace programmers are able to foresee the behavior of their programs. Which means that they are
in effect capable of hurdling errors.
