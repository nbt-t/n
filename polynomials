[[math]]
In the least, all [[algebra|algebraic expression]] is framed of, except itself, by the exp: *abᵏ* such that *a ∈ R and k ∈ W*. This unit
of exp getting the name of *monomial*. Therefore, as all units, they can be compounded: *binomials*, *trinomials*, all of
which *polynomials* that are sums of monomials.

The *degree* of a polynomial is its variable's highest power *axᵏ* such that *a ≠ 0*

= Laws of Polynomial Combination =
* axᵏ+bxᵏ, *sum of polynomials*: (a+b)xᵏ
* (axᵏ)(bxᵏ), *product of polynomials*: just [[distributive property]].
