[[philosohy]]
It's the character of any [[object]] at a [[time|particular moment]].

States don't disappear but evolve by the agency of [[time]].

The basic state, from which all the others emanate, is [[existence]]. By such, this and its subordinate states are only
actionable inside the [[existence]].

Things undergo multiple states concurrently.

Hereby, I promulgate the *basic state to be existence*, and all its *dependent states to be subordinates*; therefore, if
existence is off, subordinate states do not compute.

To illustrate, to the existence of, say, a tangible object, largeness applies, that is to say, any physical object has an
[[objective]] measure of largeness. Furthermore, material state, an objective state of matter, and so on.

Given the [[processes_evolution_of_states|volatility of states]], all states can be *measured*; the notion of *measure* is issued by states.

The measure of any state being, as state itself, isolated to a particular time.

All states under human discretion have [[objectivty_vs_subjectivity|subjective]] *measures*, and, as consequence, *subjective extremes*, within which the
[[mind]] classifies them, in turn. Say goodness, for example, which is a subjective state, to the utmost possible, has
two extremes *set by the Mind* between which changing measures string.
FIXME: All states have extremes. Meta-states in between such extremes.
