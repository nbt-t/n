A feedback loop is that in which the output affects itself.

Causes serve as effect which serve as further cause.

Causes serve as effect and effects as cause, infinitely.

The effect/output/reaction of cause influences the cause's effect itself.

The effect influences the cause which in turn influence the cause's effect itself.

The cause of an effect is influenced by the effect itself, which determines such effect.

Even one small output in a positive feedback loop can trigger behemoth effect.
