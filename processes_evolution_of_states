Based on the dynamic nature of [[time]], [[state|states]] are volatile. From moment to moment they are prone to evolve, and by
this span in between temporal boundaries the definition of a *process* is shadowed forth: the span during which a state
evolves.

All processes are governed by rules, which dictate the forces compelling a state to evolve.

Processes are manifestations of such rules. The rules being abstract versus their processes, which might be observable
phenomenons; that is to say that processes are more tangible than rules, they are testaments to them.
