[[logic]] [[philosophy]] [[math]]
*Empirical induction*, or *induction*, is the work of deriving, by observation, the general nature of a phenomenon
from its particular instances.

Induction as in by use of [[inductive logic]], probabilistic. And empirical speaks of sensible advertence upon cogent
set of instances (as opposed to deliberate investigation, logical)?

The security of propositions lied against by empirical induction rests in function of the number of
observations, and consecutive confirmations, on instances of any phenomenon.

The faulty but pragmatic principle of empirical induction: *what has been will stay coherent with what will*,
for the future is damned unpredictable. We can *exclusively contend what's most problable*. So, for example, the
[[generalization]]: "John always goes to school by Uber", from a cogent set of instances, is at first true. But the
future is unpredictable, it is not certain that the future will behave like the past, making the statement
unprovable.

Moreover, it's troublesome to prove induction by induction, as it is [[circular reasoning]], by assuming that it has
served truly in the past, and therefore, it will keep so in the future; *induction cannot be proved by induction*.

Immediately, the dilemma can be sensed: *if generalizations never made because of said logical blunder, then*
*nothing could be known securely*. All action would be appended with uncertain effect, utter uncertainty.
