*Mistakes* come from a special sort of ignorance: that which does not know
of ignorance about an action's effects. For instance, let there be a person, roaming in the streets
with a phone in use, in proceeding with such action the folk could possibly consider his phone being
robbed as a negative effect, but myiriad additional undesired effects could emerge, namely: dropping
phone due to heedless floor tumble, getting wounded by falling on floor from unattended ground,
amongst other possible consequences.

A *mistake* is an undesired effect from an action. Therefore, to guard oneself from mistakes,
one must take in regard all circumstances speaking of an action inducing in mistake.
