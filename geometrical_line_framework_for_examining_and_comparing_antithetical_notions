[[philosohpy]] [[math]] [[geometry]]
Geometry's object of line can be translated to the [[subjective]] typing of [[object|objects]] under [[antithetical_notions_opposites_and_extremes|antitheses]].

Let it be named *Antithetical Line*. It can be infinite as the geometry's, tuned to retain an infinitely
escalating thicket of [[instances]] as units in which progression is deduced from the comparison of existent
instances. Differently, it does not expand by [[Unity]] like in mathematics, but of a precedential
evolution; subtraction is not suitable to operate on instances, the order is merely concerned with intensity.

The maximum and minimum values of each extreme are not retrieved quantitatively, in place, comparing
intensities.

Each antithesis's extreme, graphically, is to disregarded of its location being left or right; the semantics
do not veer from the discussed.

Individuals nurture these Antithetical Lines constantly from [[experience]]. Upon experiencing novel instances,
the line is automatically updated in function of intensity.

When a new instance supersedes the minimum or maximum instance of the line, it momentarily unsettles the
individual. Consider an Antithetical Line related to weights of pens, if it happened one stumbled upon an
obscenely lightweight pen, it can be seamlessly manipulated, one would certainly be engrossed in strangeness
until short.

Blending with the progression of integers in a geometrical line: for the left extreme farther to the left the
lesser the intensity, and in right extreme farther to the right the grander the intensity; farther to the left
in left extreme means greater the right extreme, and farther to right in right extreme means lesser in left
extreme.
   
Min Good (Nearest to Evil)   Max Evil (Farthest to Good)
    |                                       |
    |           <- Good   Evil ->           |
<---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--->
   -5  -4  -3  -2  -1   0   1   2   3   4   5
                    |       |
					|       |
             Max Good       Least Evil
        (Farthest to Evil)  (Nearest to Good) 

All units of either extreme can be esteemed in relation to the other extreme; comparing the distance from a
extreme's unit to the counter extreme.

Geometry's line itself is an antithetical line flanked by infinite advance of quantity.

Probablity of coming across a min-max instance sinks as the line continually expands in any direction, either
way granting favor to minimum or maximum, towards impossible infinity. Or in the same vein, amidst the
conjunction of min-max cases to an antithetical instantial set and likelihood of one catching an even more
surpassing case, there binds inverse proportion.

= Antithetical Lines as Defined by their Extremes =
* Good & Evil
* Bright & Dark
* Hot & Cold
* Positive & Negative
* Heavy & Lightweight
* Big & Small
* Near & Far
* Lean & Fat
* Up & Down
* Addition & Subtraction
* Infinity & Finity (incongruous)
* Intellengce & Dumness
* Greater & Lesser
* Weird & Normal
* Void & Full
* Open & Closed
