If the disposition is to factor in operation's result as operand, in place of straight-up value, to recover
parenthesizing such operation for earlier calculation. That stems leftmost value lodging in operation as operand
from unexistent parenthesizing according to the [[operator_precedence]]
{{{python
val1, val2 = 3, 2
print('even' if val1+val2 % 2 == 0 else 'odd') # -> even. Modulus' precedence is intenser and, therefore, the
# semantical error lies in the undone parenthesizing given the sum of those values as the whole to compute
# for evenness.
}}}
FIXME: Link(s).
FIXME: Classify as semantical error and define first parahraph through higher operator precedence.
