Computational instructions are blurred to our monkey mind when such circumstances frame:

* *Recursive/Circular/Self-Referencing Variable Assingment*: When a variable assigment references itself, or another
  variable, the mind has to compute the meaning of the variables inside such statement and, furthermore, the
  the computation involving such variables for afterwards remapping the variable's value.
  
* *Volatility of Variable*: The mind can readily handle variables pestering for change, but still, it is a minor
  additioned load. It effectively grows when combined with *recursive/circular/self-referencing variable assignments*.
