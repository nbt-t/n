[[philosohpy]] [[set_theory]]
*Reality* is an independent [[state]] from the [[mind]], that is, Reality is an unhinged state upon awareness of Reality.

The [[unit]] of reality and existence is *object*; whatever lies inside reality is *object*, and whatever [[experience]] has
clutched is an *object*.

Existence is characterized by the set of objects one has sensed.

Reality is [[objective]] and existence is [[subjective]].

Any real object might not exit, and not all objects that exist are real, which implies physical manifestation
for [[true]] reality.

Reality is defined by a [[recursive]] function which base case is [[God]], thereupon, hereby such 
function: until God, *someobject is because a preliminary object is*, expressed as a procedure:
{{{python
def Reality(object):
	if object == 0:
		return 'God'
	else:
		return Reality(object-1)
}}}
There was no time before the univserse.

In such sense, it can be deduced Reality is handiwork of God.

We make the fundamental assumption that what is of experience is real.

FIXME: Did the universe always exist?
FIXME: Link(s). superset.
FIXME: Reality has to do with God? Define reality.
