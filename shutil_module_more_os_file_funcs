The *shutil* (_shell utilities_) module is in seize of nifty file manipulation functions, as such:

* `rmtree()`: This function will sink a folder, with its contents.

* `copy()`: Which will copy a file, first argument, to a given path, second argument.

* `copytree()`: Mitigating the confine of only files, this function will carry out the same as `copy()` but for directories.

* `move()`: This function will move a file, first argument, to a specified path, second argument.

Now, the `os.unlink()` function fulfills when desirous of deleting _just_ a file. And the
`os.rmdir()` function for _empty_ directories.

The `os.walk()` function serves the purpose of scanning an utter directory tree, all its files
and subdirectories.
