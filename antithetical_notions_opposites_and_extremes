[[philosohpy]]
*Antithetical Notions*, or *Antitheses*, maintain as necessary [[endowments]] a [[circularly dependent]] connection in which
each extreme lives off the other, and, thereupon, the [[categorization]] of an [[reality_and_existence_the_deepest_underpinning_constructs|object]] within one extreme makes
ineludible possiblity of the other marking. And when the notions are purely quantitative, there can be infinitely
as much instances of
the individual's knowledge but to [[quantity]], they are [[objective]]; so they, as a result, lack [[finity]]. And [[subjective]]
in the opposite.

So if you find yourself immersed in a personally cold water bath, and a folk whose home lies in the north pole,
plunges next to you inside the bath, and dazzled he remarks: "Wonderful fellow, this is good hot water", it does
not compute individually until you [[empathy_contra_sympathy|displace yourself onto that person's knowledge]].
