The *interface* of a function is its account: what it does, its parameters, return value(s), etc.
Therefore, good interfaces are simple on the caller's vision.

More concisely, the interface of a function is the part of its header and documentation.

The prior descriptions can be generalized to a program, given that: a function is program inside
a program, a unit of instructions inside another unit of instructions. A program's interface is the
set of details concerning input, output, and parameters.

Interfaces are black boxes exhibiting input-output relations and possible parameters of any
procedure.
