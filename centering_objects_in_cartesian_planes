Before all, the horizontal or vertical center is computed by half trucation of plane's width (x, 0) or height
(0, y); inferentially, computation of both if the will is to center bi-axially (x, y).

Posteriorly, if it be satisfied the condition about the object's length, either horizontally or vertically,
greater than 1, it follows to subtract the object's half from the center coordinate and voila!
