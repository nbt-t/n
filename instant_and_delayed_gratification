Both of the antithetical subjects refer to the waiting interval for getting gratification from certain action; narrower
intervals speaking of earlier reward from action's start, and wider ones of later reward.

Regularly participating in action of rapid reward conditions the mind into conceiving other, more delayed activities
(i.e, thinking, working out) increasingly painful due to the now clear ado for touching the reward.

With that in hold, one should reprimand all activity, ideally, that partakes of narrow epochs from action to gratification,
thus solely acquainting the mind with action that shouts for slog to derive reward.

*Activity of instant gratification neglect endeavour for reward*.

*The incorrect life would be one sluaghtered with neglicence for reward*.
