Logic is the study of the methods and principles used in setting apart correct from incorrect reasoning.

Logic is a directive field, its intent is to prescribe how one ought to reason, versus psychology, which describes
the way [[mind]] operates.

That is, it directly deals with differentiating correct from incorrect reasoning.

Classifying the validity of arguments, in the reckoning of how a conclusion ensues after prior statements,
called premises, with some probability or certainty, is what marks logic basically.

Deductive Logic addresses arguments as boolean situations, they're either true or false; it is concerned with
boolean inferences.

The conclusion for any deductive argument must, for true, inescapably proceed.

Example of false deductive argument:

	The consolidation of quantities equals the total. Therefore, 1+1=3.

Whereas for probabilistic guesswork in which the premises ain't boolean, Inductive Logic. It deals with the
probability of conclusions preceded by likely premises.

Connectedly, an inductive argument is one whose conclusion is claimed to proceed with probability.

Example of very probable inductive argument:
	The other one got a rise out of him and sure he got exasperated. That's why I think he killed him, that
	the slayed kid the wrong guy.

To infer is to ideate proposition whose truth is fancied connected to prior propositions. To be mistaken not
with implication, which is the logical relation between propositions.

The relationship held between premises and conclusion is hailed entailment.
