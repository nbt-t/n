[[math]]
*Arithmetic* deals with the properties about the workings of the basic operations on numbers.

All of which [[addition_and_subtraction|addition]] (+), [[addition_and_subtraction|subtraction]] (-), [[multiplication_and_division|multiplication]] (*), and [[multiplication_and_division|division]] (รท) comprise the basic operations.
[[Addition only existent when subtraction, and subtraction also only when addition]]: for to be able to add there
has have been less, and to subtract, more.

The last two are, in the deep, governed by addition and its inverse. Therefore, the quintessential operations
with quantity are unshrouded: *addition* and *subtraction*.

It's is fixed, specific, as it is not the [[algebra|countepart]]. It serves as a framework for inferring [[generalization|generalizations]], by the
analysis of the properties concerning the basic operations with numbers, appropiate to the algebraic field. To illustrate:

{*5-2 = 3*, *10-2 = 8 & 10 = 2+8*, *20-19 = 1 & 20 = 19+1*...}

Upon that set of instances, the [[algebraic expression]] is made: for *a-b = c*, *a = b+c*.
