A powerful programming language confers a medium for referring to data through _variables_.
A variable is a _name_ whose value is a _computational object_, that is, it's an association between
a _name_ and a _computational object_.

Variables are the foundational means of a programming language for abstraction; deeming data
collectively as units.
