[[anki]]
One should avoid the insertion of vehemently disconnected, or uninteresting, cards
up into Anki, knowing that such cards will likely evaporate off memory in ephemeral time and will
only transform into an extra burden.

Upon creating cards about any new subject, one should terminate the quantity of cards superior to
1, for the aim of at least beginning with an initial thread of anchor.
