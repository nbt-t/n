[[philosohpy]]
The bridging between external media and conferred [[meaning]] is an [[abstraction_and_generalization|abstraction]]. The notablest of media being symbol
and sound. They allow us to materialze and externalize meaning out the world; we wouldn't be able to express
meaning, and it'd hence stick stranded internally, if these media were altogether scarce.

Deeply bottom, meaning is acquired in [[experience]], independent of the media themselves. And such media are only
serve the inclination for interacting with other [[minds]].

Shape of expression with such media is [[arbitrary]], only reason of [[time]] and [[complexity]] is guided by.

Meaning of these media can be deduced by experimenting with the [[Interindividual Feedback Loop]], either actively
or passively. Through sufficient repetition of turning mind over the [[input-output relation]], and [[context]],
between the expressed and the response. Essentially, [[Black Box Illumination]].

The meaning is the filtered upon abstraction.

If multiple shapes for expressing same meaning through media, it's also a generalization taken into concern 
fragment of such shapes.
