A *combination* is an application of a procedure upon a defined expression delimited by
parentheses.

A *procedure* is a definition of action about how to manipulate data. Or, a description of a
process.

*Data* is the actionable entity to be manipulated by procedures.

Defining variables means Lisp has to hold an account of such by storing them in the memory. The
place where this storage dwells is called an *enviroment*.
