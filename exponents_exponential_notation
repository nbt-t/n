[[math]]
It's a [[quantity idiom]] that employs two numbers: the number that's going to multiply upon itself, *base*, and the amount of
times that such number will do as such with itself, *exponent*.

To work with *exponential expressions*, it is prime to follow such correspondences:

* aᵐ*aⁿ = aⁿ⁺ᵐ, if two multypling powers of the same base, to add their exponents.
* (aᵐ)ⁿ = aᵐ ⃰ⁿ, if a power of a power, to multiply both powers.
* (a/b)ᵐ = aᵐ/bᵐ, if a power of a fraction, to distribute each exponent onto numerator and denominator.
* (a/b)⁻ᵐ = b/an, if a negative power of a fraction, to swap numerator and denominator, and change exponent sign.
* (aᵐ/aⁿ) = aᵐ⁻ⁿ, if fraction where numerator and denominator are alike, both raised to a power, to subtract the exponents.
* (ab)ᵐ = aᵐ*bᵐ, if power of a product, to multiply the powers of each factor.
* a⁻ᵐ/b⁻ⁿ = bᵐ/aⁿ, if two negative powers in both fractional sides, to swap sides and change exponent signs.

For any power of a^0, the result is 1 that follows, for if a number is multiplied by itself less than 1, and greater
than -1 times, it is only the base that remains.


From any power of a^-n, such that n is a positive integer, an equality can be set: 1/an.
