An *expression* is a combination of values, variables, and operators. All of such, by
themselves, are also considered expressions.

A *statement* is a unit of code that has an effect; or does someobject.

A *function* is a collective unit of instructions that can be called by a name. In such
sense, functions hold similarity with variables, in that they are both abstraction
mechanisms that link names with expressions.

In a function definition, the first line is the *header*, and the collection of all
its subsequent lines is called the *body*.
