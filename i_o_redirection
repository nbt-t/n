*I/O redirection* is the process of changing the default file descriptor to which a program
will send its output or receive its input. Alternatively, it's the process of redirecting
the input or ouput stream source of a program.

= I/O Redirection Operators =
* *> or <*: Greater than (>) is stdout -> source, and less than (<) is stdin <- source.
In using the > operator, the source, for a file, is firstly created prior to the
output redirection.

* *>> or <<*: Same but append

* *Pipe (|)*: Instead of redirecting output to a file, sends it to the input of an
ensuing command.
