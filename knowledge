The state of knowing someobject inevitably arises from *ignorance*: void knowledge about such matter. If one was
never aware of hollow knowledge about a object, then, one does not know such object, only knows
*tangible projections* of such.

Knowledge is an *indepent being from the human mind*, that is, knowledge never changes but it is our perception about
the object of knowledge that shifts.

If there's *difference in discretion* about an affair, among individuals, then, such affair is not known.

Satisfied the precondition of using logic appropiately, then, dissent between two individuals about a matter
is impossible. Thereupon, if two individuals do not match in opinion about a matter, either of them has wrong
conception on the object in which disaccord occurs.
