What is *tangible*, [[objectivty_vs_subjectivity|subjectively]], can be attended by any of the human senses. Inefficient subjectivity more
readily identifed after sinking onto cases in which an individual may sense objects in the external world that
may not exist in the [[mind]] of the herd, nay insane, which, in turn, inevitably brings up dubious discretion about
the herd's sanity too, undisguising this [[logicall fallacy]] of [[circular reasoning]]; or it may well be we're all
insane and those who dissent in perception are righteous. Hence it is concluded that [[existence|existence does not reckon]]
[[existence|upon mind]].
