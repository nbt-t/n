*Statistics* is the knowledge field focusing on the recollection, organization, and interpretation of data.

Statistics underscoring the context, a *population* is a set of items which are of interest.

*Frequency distribution* is a way of distributing the items from a population over *groups*, or *classes*, that correspond
with their respective frequencies.

*Groups* or *classes* are commonly ranges in frequency distributions.

To sketch a frequency distribution table, compute the range, divide the range over arbitrary number of classes, the result
is going to be *class amplitude*.

The start value of all classes, except the first, the first is lowest value, is the end value of previous class plus 1.

The end value is going to be start value plus class amplitude.

Next to each class, write the frequency.
