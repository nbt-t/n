[[math]]
A *factor* is a number that influences/has bearing on/exerts magnitude upon a [[product]].

*Factorization/Factoring* as [[processes_evolution_of_states|process]] is then evolved: *formulating an* [[math|expression]] *as multiplication of factors*, all
of which [[addition_and_substraction|simpler particles of a complexer]] [[numbers_and_quantity|quantity]].

The operation of the [[laws_of_arithmetic|distributive property]] mutually links with *factorization/factoring*: the former expands with coefficient
common to all terms, to which *common factor* is the nomenclature, while the latter goes about the discovery of such factors;
the inverse process of distribution is factorization/factoring.

Expectantly, making up any-object from its simpler elements is ligther on complexity/difficulty than reverse-engineering the
elements of a higher hierarchy.

= Factoring Trinomials =

* *x²+bx+c, (x+r)(x+s)=x²+(r+s)x+rs*: Find r+s that commune with b and rs with c.

* *ax²+bx+c, (px+r)(qx+s) = pqx²+(ps+qr)x+rs*: Find pq equal to a, ps+qr equal to b, and rs equal to c.

FIXME: New note/idea/generalization? "All of which are simpler particles of a complexer quantity".
FIXME: Inverse relationship generalization/note? All equality is valid from both sides, 2 = 3 therefore 3 = 2.
FIXME: Identity law. Complete.
FIXME: Noticing patterns/generalizations of mathematical equations with graphs.
FIXME: Visualizing them with graphs.
