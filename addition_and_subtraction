[[math]] [[arithmetic]]

Addition and substraction are opposites. Addition is counting onwards and substraction is counting
downwards; *10+5 means, from 10, count 5 onwards, and 10-5, from 10, count 5 downwards*.

It can be inferred substraction from the equation of addition, and viceversa:

*x = y+z*
*z = x-y*

*6 = 5+1*
*1 = 6-5*

*x-y* means: what quantity have I to add with *y* in order to get *x*, such resulting quantity
being *z*.

*y < x > z, such that y and z are positive numbers*; which equals in saying: for all positive numbers, the
consolidation of a quantities is always greater than those subquantities.

Conversely, *z â‰¤ x, such that y is a non-zero number*; in plain language, the subtracted quantity
is always less than the initial quantity.

The stemming relation between addition against substraction is made ostensible:

*(a+b)-b = a*, since evolving from addition to substraction twists the former effect, if one adds
a number and, forthwith, wrenches it, the final quantity will be equal to the initial.
