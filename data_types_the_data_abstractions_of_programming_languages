Data types are the [[abstraction_and_generalization|abstractions]] of [[data]] in [[programming languages]]. They define the category to which data belongs,
and the [[operations]] that can be performed upon it.

To demonstrate simply, the *Car* data type shall I employ. It is indicative of all [[abstraction_and_generalization|instances]] of a car and has
conjoined all apt operations upon them; it can be driven, primordially.

Every [[reality_and_existence_the_deepest_underpinning_constructs|object]] belongs to a data type in [[reality_and_existence_the_deepest_underpinning_constructs|existence]].

A data type refers to *class*.

A *class* in itself is a *class object*.

Objects from a class/type are instances of it. Cohesively, the [[process]] of bringing about instance is called
*instantiation*.
