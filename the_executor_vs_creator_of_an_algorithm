There's a difference in mental effort bestowed upon the generation of an algorithm against the execution: the folk
that conceived had to exert himself, mentally, for it, while the counterpart, the executor, only needs to read
the language in which the algorithm was framed.

It is unwieldy the brain in trying to write an algorithm because it involves the meticulous pinpointing of every
action to be taken in order to solve a given problem. It also furthers that it is better, as in time, to lay
an algorithm gracefully in a manner that wastes the least time to solve a problem, that furthers the endeavour.
While not thinking algorithmitcally, unconsciously of each step, for a human being engaged in a casual task,
it is easier as we abstract ourselves off the steps to accomplish a task because we are clumsy and slow.
