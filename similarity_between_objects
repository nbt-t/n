Between two objects is said to lie *equality* if they retain the same [[an_objects_value|value]], but solely *identical* when they are
_equal in value and object itself_.

If two objects are _equal_, not they're inescapbably _identical_, they may merely have to the same value. But when _identical_,
both roam under the clutches of whole equality.
