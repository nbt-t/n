=  What is it, CSS? =
*Cascading Style Sheets* (aka _CSS_) is a language used to modify the HTML visual representation
of a website, that is, to _customize_ a website's depiction of its structure.

= Relation between HTML & CSS =
Thereby, it is crystallized the difference between the two (_HTML_ and _CSS_), HTML deals with
_structure_, while CSS is concerned with the _appearance_ of structure.

= Styling with CSS =
One can _style_ an HTML website with CSS by specifying the *<style>* element's CSS rules inside *<head>* element.
