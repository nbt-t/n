*Altruism*, it isn't. The notion of *consciously* serving benefit to another with no gain, or *selfless behavior*, is
false. All human action is based on fulfilling, rationally, regarding that one does something as a result of
wanting, and the object of wanting, necessarily,  must be an object that supplies satisfaction, otherwise, there
is not stimulus towards an action. Therefore, in any deed of giving, there's an exchange of gains, may of equal
size not be, but, regardless, one receives satisfaction. As example, giving an object of which one is aware
certain individual will appreciate, inevitably, sprouts satisfaction in oneself.
