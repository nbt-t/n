* *Thinking about efficient knowledge formulation*: Considering how to efficiently 
  formulate (small input + long retention + deep understanding) ideas, that is, contriving
  frameworks for formulating knowledge, is crucial for reaching nirvana in understanding and
  retention.
  
* *Connection*: I think, the most predominant part of knowledge formulation is *connection*.
  Richer connections speaking of an idea yield greater efficiency in the conception and retention of
  such idea. Images, analogies, and like-concepts are instances of association media.
  
* *External knowledge media don't suffice*: All objects are made of smaller objects, until a certain
  limit, to be sure, that is for complexity too. To arrive at any complexity about any such idea,
  external knowledge media, such as google, notebooks, and books, are not efficient due to the
  limited brain agency, and the time that naturally cannot be recovered, of a human being for
  grasping multiple concepts almost at once. Now, one can gradually build up knowledge, without
  the large time overhead of routinely looking up a matter and trying to get a sense of it, by
  comitting ideas to long-term memory, forming abstractions which is marginally faster than having
  to look up, ad hoc, all the integral subconcepts of any concept to then, in turn, grasp such
  concept.
