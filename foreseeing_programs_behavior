[[programming]]
The pinnacle of programming proficiency is the *precise foresight of programs' behavior*, for if lacking,
both rapidity of programming and execution will not be consistently developed; you cannot improve neither rapidity of
programming nor execution, _by yourself_, if you do not understand the behavior of programs, that is, the instructions
that make them up.
