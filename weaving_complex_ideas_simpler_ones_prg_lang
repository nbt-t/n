[[cs]]
Any _powerful_ programming language allows the user to consolidate simple ideas weaving complex
ones. For performing this, powerful programming languages provide users with three fundamental
bases:

* *Primitive expressions*, which are the simplest beings inside a language.
* *Means of combination*, by which compound elements are constructed from simpler ones.
* *Means of abstraction*, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as single
entities.
