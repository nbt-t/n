A *computational instruction* is any action described in the [[computer's language]] for it to carry out
through execution.

An *instructional unit* is any sequence of computational instructions [[abstraction_and_generalization|abstracted]] to a name, viz: *program*,
*subroutine*, *function*, *procedure*.

The execution pattern of programs perfectly resembles [[black boxes]]: you feed a machine with somethnig, and
it outputs someobject, the feeder doing so unknowingly of the program's internal mechanics.

Every computational unit of instruction is a [[abstraction_and_generalization|generalization]] from of foundationally consistent set of
input-output relations.
